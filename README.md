# Reference Point Smartcard SDK

The Smartcard SDK is a set of software libraries designed to allow an application developer to read data from JCOP compliant physical smartcards and virtual smartcards, CSCS virtual smartcards, and smartcards residing in Reference Point's Vircarda smartphone application.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/reference-point/SmartcardSDK/wiki) for details of how to acquire and use the SDK

N.B. Use of the SDK to read CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) cards is reliant upon acceptance of the following [licence agreement](https://github.com/reference-point/SmartcardSDK/wiki/Licence-agreement)
