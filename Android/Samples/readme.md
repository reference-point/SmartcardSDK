# Android Sample App - Kotlin

Download the zip file and extract.

Open in Android Studio. 

Before running, you will need to insert your api-key and app-identifier-name into the variables in the initSDK() function.

Launch the app on a connected device, let the SDK initialise, then you should be good to read CSCS cards by presenting them to the back of the device.

Note the different sync modes which you can set in the readCard function.
