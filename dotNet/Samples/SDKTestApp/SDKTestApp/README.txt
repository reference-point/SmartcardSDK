*** RPL Smartcard SDK example app ***

This is a simple command line application which will :
- initialise the SDK
- use the SDK to read data from a physical smartcard via NFC
- parse the card data read from the card (it is assumed to be in CSCS format)
- use the SDK to render the card front and rear images and write them to disk


The project is built using Visual Studio 2017 (v 15.5.2)

N.B. to run the app you will need to fill in your SDK credentials and a local temporary path at the top of Program.cs
